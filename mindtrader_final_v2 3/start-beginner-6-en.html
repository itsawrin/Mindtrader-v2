    <h2>What is a Whitepaper and Project Team?</h2>
    <p><strong>Whitepaper</strong> is an official document that explains what a crypto project is about, what problem it solves, and how it works.</p>
    <p>For example, Ethereum has a whitepaper written by <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong>, explaining the idea of smart contracts.</p>
    <p>The <strong>team</strong> includes developers, managers, and advisors who build and maintain the project. Cardano was founded by <strong>Charles Hoskinson</strong>, one of Ethereum’s co-founders.</p>
    <p>How to check if a project is legit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Look for the whitepaper on the official website (usually on the homepage or About section).</li>
        <li>Websites like <strong>CoinMarketCap</strong> and <strong>CoinGecko</strong> show whitepaper links and team details.</li>
        <li>If the team is hidden or photos look fake, that’s a red flag!</li>
    </ul>
