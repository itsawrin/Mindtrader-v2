    <h2>What are Altcoins and Shitcoins?</h2>
    <p><strong>Altcoin:</strong> Any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Some of the most well-known ones include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong> – (Utility / Platform Token)</li>
        <li><strong>Solana (SOL)</strong> – (Utility Token)</li>
        <li><strong>Cardano (ADA)</strong> – (Utility + Governance Token)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Shitcoin:</strong> A crypto with no clear purpose, project, or utility — often made for fun or pump-and-dump (artificially raising the price through hype and selling at the peak). Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pepe Coin</strong> – (Meme token with no real-world use)</li>
        <li><strong>SafeMoon</strong> – (Hyped token that later lost most of its value)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Some shitcoins can be scam projects that may wipe out your money. Investing heavily in them is like gambling and not recommended.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Difference:</strong> Altcoins usually solve real problems, have a dev team, and long-term goals. Shitcoins are mostly useless and driven by hype.</p>
